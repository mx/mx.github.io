  <body>
    <p>Just a basic homepage for a few of my random musings or useful things. I don't like fancy web tools and stuff so all of this is written by hand in plain html/css/javascript.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="roller.html">Dice roller</a> for my D&amp;D game.</li>
      <li><a href="speedcontrols.html">About mechanical vs. electronic speed controls.</a></li>
      <li><a href="surge/scope_proposal.html">Design doc</a> for an inbuilt oscilloscope for <a href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io">Surge synthesizer.</a></li>
      <li><a href="ai/format_proposal.html">Design doc</a> for an extensible model format for image generation (diffusion) models and their frontends.</li>
    </ul>
